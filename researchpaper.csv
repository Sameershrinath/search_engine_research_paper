PA001,HARDIK GAUR,Outer Space Exploration and the SustainabiIity of the Space Environment-An Uneasy Relationship,"In contrast with the early years of space flight that were dominated by the political priorities and military concerns of the two superpowers, the USA and the then Soviet Union, a new space era has dawned where not only states are involved as serious actors in the space arena, but also private companies. Because of the significant increase in the number of space actors, outer space is becoming a congested and competitive environment. It is self-evident that the significant increase in private and state-sponsored space ventures has serious implications for the protection and sustainability of the outer space environment. Specifically, the proliferation of space debris and the current lack of protection of vulnerable scientific, historical, and cultural sites on celestial bodies are issues of concern. Several measures to balance the seemingly competing interests of space exploration and the sustainability of the space environment have been suggested. This article aims to discuss these measures and to assess to what extent they are in conformity with the current outer space governance regime. It is concluded that the measures suggested to actively address the space debris problem and to protect the cultural heritage in space may contravene the Outer Space Treaty, especially the rules and prohibitions regarding property rights in space. Moreover, whilst the removal of orbital debris is essential to ensure the sustainable use of the outer space environment, some space junk may have cultural significance and be worthy of protection. A balance should thus be struck between preserving cultural heritage and managing the risks posed by space debris. It is therefore recommended that the development of interim soft-law rules (and an eventual treaty) should be undertaken under the auspices of existing United Nations bodies, namely the UNCOPUOS and UNESCO.","Outer space; sustainability; space debris; outer space heritage;

[cite_start]This poses challenges to the sustainability of the space environment, particularly due to the proliferation of space debris and the lack of protection for vulnerable cultural and historical sites on celestial bodies[cite: 30, 31, 32, 33].

[cite_start]Current space law, as embodied in the Outer Space Treaty, is criticized for its anthropocentric (human-centered) approach, prioritizing human interests and the exploitation of resources over environmental protection[cite: 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244]. [cite_start]The treaty's provisions are often vague and do not explicitly address issues like space debris or the preservation of space heritage[cite: 458, 459, 460, 477, 478, 728]. [cite_start]While some international and national efforts, such as voluntary guidelines, have been made, they are not legally binding[cite: 478, 479, 480, 481, 482].

[cite_start]The paper concludes that there is an uneasy relationship between space exploration and environmental sustainability[cite: 904]. [cite_start]It recommends developing new, legally binding ""soft-law"" rules and an eventual treaty under the auspices of UNCOPUOS and UNESCO to address the active removal of space debris and the protection of cultural heritage in space[cite: 907, 908, 911, 980, 982]. [cite_start]These rules would need to define terms like ""space debris"" and ""space object,"" and establish clear guidelines for property rights and ""safety zones"" around heritage sites to balance competing interests without violating the principle of non-appropriation[cite: 929, 930, 931, 933, 934, 935, 980].

This research paper titled ""Outer Space Exploration and the Sustainability of the Space Environment - An Uneasy Relationship"" by A Ferreira-Snyman examines the growing conflict between increasing space activities and the need to preserve the outer space environment. The author argues that the new era of space exploration, which includes private companies, is leading to a more congested and competitive environment, raising serious concerns about space debris and the protection of cultural and historical sites on celestial bodies. The paper analyzes the shortcomings of the existing legal framework, particularly the Outer Space Treaty, which it characterizes as anthropocentric and inadequate for addressing modern environmental and heritage issues in space. The research concludes that a new, cooperative approach is necessary, recommending the development of interim ""soft-law"" rules and a future binding treaty under the guidance of UN bodies like UNCOPUOS and UNESCO. The proposed framework would address critical issues such as defining space debris, clarifying property rights, and establishing safety zones around heritage sites, aiming to strike a balance between space exploration and the long-term sustainability of the space environment for all of humanity.

PA003,HARDIK GAUR,Human Health during Space Travel: State-of-the-Art Review,"The field of human space travel is in the midst of a dramatic revolution. Upcoming missions are looking to push the boundaries of space travel, with plans to travel for longer distances and durations than ever before. Both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and several commercial space companies (e.g., Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic) have already started the process of preparing for long-distance, long-duration space exploration and currently plan to explore inner solar planets (e.g., Mars) by the 2030s. With the emergence of space tourism, space travel has materialized as a potential new, exciting frontier of business, hospitality, medicine, and technology in the coming years. However, current evidence regarding human health in space is very limited, particularly pertaining to short-term and long-term space travel. This review synthesizes developments across the continuum of space health including prior studies and unpublished data from NASA related to each individual organ system, and medical screening prior to space travel. We categorized the extraterrestrial environment into exogenous (e.g., space radiation and microgravity) and endogenous processes (e.g., alteration of humans’ natural circadian rhythm and mental health due to confinement, isolation, immobilization, and lack of social interaction) and their various effects on human health. The aim of this review is to explore the potential health challenges associated with space travel and how they may be overcome in order to enable new paradigms for space health, as well as the use of emerging Artificial Intelligence based (AI) technology to propel future space health research","human health, space travel, space mission, space exploration, space radiation, microgravity","
This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of human health during space travel, synthesizing data from prior studies and unpublished NASA information. It explores the health challenges posed by the space environment, categorizing them into exogenous factors (like space radiation and microgravity) and endogenous processes (such as mental health and circadian rhythm disruptions).

The review discusses the effects on various organ systems, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, hematologic, oncologic, neurologic, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal systems. It also examines medical screening procedures before, during, and after missions, and potential countermeasures.

A significant part of the review is dedicated to the role of AI in advancing space health research. The authors propose AI applications for risk prediction, inflight monitoring, diagnostic tools, and disease prevention. This includes using AI to analyze multi-omics data for personalized health predictions, guide surgical procedures, and even create AI-integrated space suits. The paper underscores the urgent need for expanded research to address the risks of long-term space travel and to leverage emerging technologies to ensure the safety of future deep space missions"
PA004,Aditya Singh,Problems Astronauts Face During Space Missions,"Space missions expose astronauts to unique and serious health and psychological challenges due to prolonged stays in microgravity and isolation. Common problems include muscle atrophy, bone density loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, space radiation exposure, vision impairment, weakened immune response, and sleep disturbances. Psychological stress, isolation, and communication delays with Earth further increase mission risks. This research paper reviews NASA’s findings on astronaut health issues, analyzes their causes and long-term effects, and highlights countermeasures such as exercise regimens, nutrition, psychological support, and AI-based health monitoring tools.",Astronaut health; space missions; microgravity; space radiation; psychological stress; immune response; vision impairment; sleep disturbance,"This research paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the physiological, psychological, and environmental problems astronauts face during space missions. Extended exposure to microgravity leads to muscle atrophy, bone density reduction, cardiovascular deconditioning, and fluid redistribution, which collectively weaken the human body and impair long-term health. Additionally, cosmic radiation poses severe risks, including DNA damage, increased cancer susceptibility, and potential neurological impairments. Astronauts also suffer from vision problems such as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) due to fluid shifts in microgravity.

Beyond physical health, space missions present significant psychological challenges. Isolation, confinement, and communication delays with Earth often cause stress, anxiety, disrupted circadian rhythms, and sleep disturbances. These factors can compromise mission efficiency and increase the risk of human error in critical tasks. The weakening of the immune system and greater vulnerability to infections further complicate astronaut health management.

This study draws on NASA’s published research and medical reports to highlight these issues while also reviewing current countermeasures such as exercise devices, nutrition strategies, psychological support, and protective shielding. It concludes with future perspectives, including the integration of AI-driven health assistants and telemedicine, which could enhance astronauts’ resilience and ensure safer, longer-duration space exploration missions."
PA005,Aditya Singh,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Future Astronaut Healthcare,"Future deep-space missions to Mars and beyond will last months or years, making astronaut healthcare increasingly complex. Traditional Earth-based medical support will be limited by communication delays, while astronauts will continue to face risks such as radiation exposure, bone loss, immune dysfunction, and psychological stress. This research paper examines the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced digital technologies to revolutionize astronaut healthcare. Applications include AI-driven medical diagnosis, predictive health analytics, personalized treatment planning, and autonomous surgical assistance. The study also explores integration of wearable biosensors, telemedicine platforms, and machine learning models that simulate human physiology in space. By analyzing current research and NASA’s exploration goals, this paper envisions how AI can transform astronaut healthcare into a proactive, self-sufficient system for the next era of space exploration.",Artificial intelligence; astronaut healthcare; space medicine; telemedicine; biosensors; predictive analytics; deep-space missions,"This research paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence and emerging technologies can address the medical challenges of astronauts on long-duration space missions. With communication delays making real-time consultations with Earth impractical, autonomous AI systems can provide continuous health monitoring and medical decision support. Wearable biosensors linked to AI algorithms can detect abnormalities in vital signs, predict health risks, and recommend preventive measures. Machine learning models trained on NASA’s health data can forecast problems such as radiation effects, bone density changes, or psychological stress patterns, enabling early interventions.

Additionally, AI-powered telemedicine platforms can support remote diagnostics and treatment, while robotic surgical systems may be developed to perform emergency procedures with minimal human intervention. Personalized medicine approaches, guided by AI, can tailor nutrition, exercise, and medication plans to each astronaut’s physiology.

By synthesizing current advancements in AI, biosensors, and digital health, this paper highlights how future space missions can achieve autonomous, reliable healthcare solutions. The integration of AI into astronaut medical care is essential for safe Mars exploration and beyond, ultimately reducing mission risks and enabling sustainable human presence in deep space."
PA006,Aditya Singh,Space Debris and Its Challenges for Future Space Missions,"The rapid increase in artificial satellites and rocket launches has led to a dangerous rise in space debris orbiting Earth. This debris, ranging from defunct satellites to fragments from collisions, poses serious risks to spacecraft, the International Space Station (ISS), and future exploration missions. Even small particles traveling at orbital velocities can cause catastrophic damage. This research paper investigates the origin, scale, and potential impact of space debris on ongoing and future missions. It also reviews current strategies for debris monitoring, collision avoidance, and active removal technologies. By examining international policies and technological advancements, the paper highlights the urgent need for global cooperation to ensure the sustainable use of Earth’s orbital environment.",Space debris; orbital environment; collision risk; ISS safety; active debris removal; space sustainability,"This research paper focuses on the growing challenge of space debris and its implications for future space missions. Space debris includes defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, fragments from collisions, and abandoned mission equipment orbiting Earth. With thousands of satellites being launched annually, the orbital environment is becoming increasingly congested. At orbital speeds of up to 28,000 km/h, even a small fragment can damage spacecraft shielding, threaten astronaut safety, or disrupt satellite communications.

The paper reviews NASA and ESA reports on the scale of the debris problem, including the Kessler Syndrome, where collisions generate more fragments, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of debris growth. Current countermeasures include debris tracking systems, collision avoidance maneuvers, and guidelines for satellite deorbiting. Emerging technologies such as robotic arms, space nets, lasers, and drag sails for active debris removal are also discussed.

Additionally, the study examines international space law and the role of global cooperation in debris management. Without effective action, space debris may hinder future exploration and commercial activities. Thus, ensuring a sustainable orbital environment is critical for the long-term success of human and robotic missions in space."
PA007,Aditya Singh,Psychological Challenges of Astronauts in Long-Duration Space Missions,"Astronauts face extreme psychological challenges during long-duration missions due to isolation, confinement, disrupted circadian rhythms, and communication delays with Earth. These factors contribute to stress, anxiety, depression, and reduced cognitive performance, which can threaten mission safety. This research paper explores the psychological impact of space travel on astronauts, drawing insights from missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and NASA’s analog experiments such as HI-SEAS and NEK. It also evaluates current countermeasures, including crew selection, psychological support, virtual reality therapies, and AI-based monitoring systems. By analyzing present studies and future strategies, this paper highlights the importance of mental health management for sustainable deep-space exploration.",Astronaut psychology; isolation in space; circadian rhythm; cognitive performance; mental health; AI monitoring; deep-space missions,"This research paper investigates the psychological challenges astronauts face during prolonged space missions. Unlike short orbital flights, deep-space exploration to Mars or lunar colonies requires extended periods of confinement in small spacecraft, limited social interaction, and delayed communication with Earth. These conditions can lead to psychological stress, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and decreased team cohesion. Studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and analog environments such as NASA’s HI-SEAS in Hawaii and Russia’s NEK isolation experiments provide evidence of how isolation and monotony affect mental health.

The paper reviews countermeasures currently applied, such as careful crew selection, resilience training, and onboard recreational activities. Technological solutions, including virtual reality environments that simulate nature, and AI-driven emotional monitoring systems, are being explored to reduce stress and detect early signs of psychological issues. The role of group dynamics and cultural diversity in international crews is also analyzed, as it directly impacts cooperation and conflict resolution.

Ultimately, this study emphasizes that astronaut psychology is as critical as physical health for mission success. Effective strategies for maintaining mental well-being will be vital for future long-duration missions, ensuring astronauts remain cognitively sharp, emotionally stable, and mission-ready during humanity’s next steps into deep space."

PA009,Nirjara Jain,Instability of the Present LEO Satellite Populations,Modeling of LEO objects shows that collisions can lead to runaway growth of debris even without further launches; active mitigation is required to avoid long-term instability.,space debris; LEO; collisions; Kessler syndrome; orbital sustainability,"Liou uses orbital-propagation models and collision-fragmentation estimates to show that the current population of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is near — or has already passed — a threshold where collisions will produce more debris than orbital decay and mitigation can remove, a self-sustaining growth process often referred to as cascading or the Kessler syndrome. The study examines historical launch/fragmentation rates, models future collision probabilities under varying launch scenarios, and quantifies how disabling fragmentation sources (e.g., removing large, massive derelict objects) or reducing fragmentation cross-section could alter long-term outcomes. Key results show that even with no new launches, collisions among existing objects can increase the debris population over time, threatening the long-term usability of certain LEO bands. The paper argues for combined policy and technical solutions including stricter post-mission disposal, design-for-demise, improved tracking, and research into active debris removal (ADR) as essential measures to avoid cascade effects and preserve orbital environments for future missions."
PA010,Nirjara Jain,Engineering Challenges for Active Debris Removal,"A survey of technical, operational and economic hurdles for active debris removal (ADR) and evaluation of candidate capture/deorbit approaches.",,"This paper outlines the end-to-end engineering challenges involved in planning and executing active debris removal missions. Covering target selection, tracking and characterization, proximity operations, capture techniques (nets, harpoons, robotic arms, tethers), stabilization of tumbling targets, and controlled de-orbit, the study assesses trade-offs around mass, cost, mission complexity, and legal/regulatory constraints. It highlights the need for high-precision guidance and vision-based navigation for small chaser vehicles, robust capture strategies to handle unpredictable tumbling, and safe de-orbit paths to minimise collateral debris creation or risk to populated areas. The paper also discusses mission architectures (single large ADR craft vs. multiple small chasers), relevant ground infrastructure, and the role of international cooperation and liability frameworks in enabling ADR at scale. The work provides a practical roadmap for researchers and agencies aimed at scaling ADR from technology demonstrations to operational services, noting that economics and policy will be as important as technology in deciding which techniques are adopted."

The mission deployed test targets and executed capture experiments using a net and a harpoon, demonstrating the feasibility of these capture mechanisms under realistic microgravity conditions. It also demonstrated vision-based navigation for target approach, a drag sail for passive de-orbiting, and provided measurement data on dynamics of capture and stabilization. The mission helped identify failure modes, practical constraints on capture system mass and volume, and the importance of designing capture strategies that tolerate target tumbling and structural irregularities. RemoveDEBRIS's results have been widely cited as proof-of-concept that ADR methods can work at small mission scales and helped steer follow-up projects and commercial efforts. The paper summarizes experiment setups, telemetry results, lessons learned, and recommended next steps for scaling ADR into operational services that can be integrated with broader space sustainability strategies."

The detected signal matches the waveform predicted for a coalescing binary black hole system, allowing measurement of the component masses, spin constraints, and the distance to the source. This historic detection confirms a major prediction of general relativity and inaugurates gravitational-wave astrophysics as an observational field. The paper details the data analysis pipeline, detector calibration, noise rejection procedures, and statistical significance of the signal (far above detection threshold), as well as parameter estimation methods using matched filtering. Beyond the direct discovery, the event provided new constraints on stellar evolution channels that produce heavy black holes and enabled tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. The result catalyzed a major expansion of multi-messenger observational programs and spurred global investment in next-generation detectors."

Using an automated pipeline to detect transit signals and an injection-recovery approach to measure detection completeness, they derive occurrence rates for planets of various sizes and incident fluxes. The team reports that a non-negligible fraction of Sun-like stars hosts Earth-size planets receiving Earth-like flux, providing key input into target selection for future missions aimed at characterising Earth analogues. The study discusses the statistical uncertainties and potential biases arising from stellar characterization and detection completeness, and proposes conservative ranges for the occurrence rate. These results had strong implications for planning surveys and missions (e.g., telescope aperture and survey durations) designed to directly image or spectroscopically observe potentially habitable exoplanets."
PA014,Nirjara Jain,Detection of Methane in the Atmosphere of Mars,"Analysis of Mars Express PFS data reporting spatially and temporally varying methane concentrations, sparking debate on sources.",Mars; methane; Mars Express; atmospheric composition; astrobiology,"Formisano et al. report the detection of methane in Mars' atmosphere using the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer aboard ESA's Mars Express. The study finds a global-average mixing ratio around a few parts per billion (with spatial and temporal variability observed), which is notable because methane is short-lived in the Martian environment and thus implies active or recent production. The paper explores possible abiotic and biotic sources — ranging from serpentinization/hydrothermal activity to subsurface microbial life — and considers sinks such as oxidation by the surface or photochemical destruction. Because the measurement was among the earliest claims of modern methane on Mars, it provoked follow-up efforts from orbiters and rovers to confirm spatial/temporal variability, leading to an ongoing scientific debate with some later null detections in other datasets. The paper is historically important for stimulating substantial research into Martian trace gases, future measurement strategies, and the astrobiological significance of transient atmospheric species."

High-charge, high-energy ions present in GCRs produce dense ionization tracks which cause complex DNA damage that is more difficult to repair than damage from terrestrial radiation. The paper summarises epidemiological and laboratory data used to estimate cancer risks, discusses dose-response uncertainties, and models the increase in lifetime cancer risk for missions beyond low Earth orbit (e.g., to Mars). It highlights gaps in knowledge, including tissue-specific sensitivity to heavy ions, limited human exposure data, and uncertainties in translating animal/cellular experiments to human risk estimates. The authors recommend research priorities (better radiobiology experiments, improved shielding concepts, and real-time monitoring) and argue that radiation risk is a primary barrier to long-duration crewed missions. Their work underpins current NASA radiation protection standards and mission planning."
PA016,Nirjara Jain,A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion,Comparative HST and Spitzer spectroscopy of hot Jupiters shows diversity from clear to cloudy atmospheres; weaker water features explained by clouds/hazes.,exoplanet atmospheres; hot Jupiters; clouds; water absorption; Hubble Space Telescope,"Sing et al. present a comparative spectroscopic survey of transiting hot Jupiters using HST (and Spitzer) across optical to infrared wavelengths. By comparing transmission spectra for a sample of planets, the authors show a clear continuum ranging from planets with strong molecular absorption features (clear atmospheres) to those with muted features caused by high-altitude clouds and hazes. Importantly, the work argues that the diminished water spectral signatures in some planets are better explained by aerosols than by primordial depletion of oxygen-bearing species during formation. The paper discusses implications for atmospheric retrievals, emphasizing that cloud properties must be jointly constrained with composition, and it outlines how this diversity affects target selection for future atmospheric characterisation missions. The dataset and analysis methods set important benchmarks for comparative exoplanetology."

The paper harmonizes heterogeneous datasets and applies consistent retrieval methods to reduce biases, enabling comparative statements about how parameters (e.g., equilibrium temperature, gravity, radius) correlate with observed spectral features. Key findings include the common detection of water vapor signatures in many hot-to-warm gas giants, a correlation between atmospheric clarity and planet temperature (with cooler planets often showing more prominent clouds/hazes), and the importance of stellar activity and data quality in interpreting spectra. The study supports the transition from single-planet detailed studies to population-level inferences, guiding prioritisation for JWST and future missions."

It covers tasks like automated event detection in magnetospheric and plasma measurements, classification of waveforms and particle signatures, data-driven models for ionospheric and thermospheric density prediction, orbit and attitude estimation improvements via learned models, and ML-enabled autonomy for spacecraft operations. The paper emphasizes how the volume and complexity of modern space datasets make ML attractive for speeding discovery and operational decision-making, while also highlighting challenges such as label scarcity, domain shifts between missions, interpretability needs, and the requirement for physically informed ML to avoid spurious results. Case studies from Cassini, MAVEN, and Earth-orbiting missions illustrate successful deployments, and the authors recommend best practices around reproducibility, uncertainty quantification, and hybrid physics-ML modelling for robust scientific and operational use."

It surveys magnetic shielding and wall-less designs, low-sputter-yield materials, cathode development, and diagnostic approaches to characterise erosion. The review also discusses alternative propellants and pulsed-operation concepts intended to improve performance or reduce erosion rates. For mission planners, extending thruster service life is critical to enabling long-duration electric propulsion for GEO station-keeping, orbital transfer, or deep-space tugs. The paper synthesises laboratory lifetime tests, modelling efforts that predict erosion over mission durations, and engineering mitigations that have shown promise in prototype thrusters.

The review covers prospects for volatiles (water/ice) extraction from polar regolith, oxygen and fuel production via electrochemical or reduction processes, and construction technologies using regolith feedstocks (sintering, additive manufacturing). It discusses measurement and prospecting approaches to map resource distributions, trade-offs in system mass vs. in-situ yield, and how ISRU can transform mission architectures by reducing launch mass and supporting longer-term habitation. The paper also stresses demonstration priorities such as small-scale pilots (drill, extraction, and processing) in realistic lunar analogues and robust integration with power systems and thermal controls. Policy, commercial, and planetary protection considerations are discussed as key enablers and constraints for ISRU deployment."

PA034,HARDIK GAUR,Constructing knowledge graphs and their biomedical applications,"Knowledge graphs can support many biomedical applications. These graphs represent biomedical con-
cepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges. In this review, we discuss how these graphs
are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing
these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that
were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated
systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning
methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different appli-
cations. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph’s local and/or global structure.
Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within
genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph
construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications.
Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains,
and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly
promising.","Knowledge Graphs,Biomedical Applications, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML)

Knowledge graphs represent biomedical entities as nodes and their relationships as edges. The authors discuss how these graphs are traditionally built using manually curated databases but note a growing shift toward automated, machine learning-based approaches like text mining and natural language processing.





The paper also explores how machine learning techniques, such as matrix factorization and neural networks, are used to create low-dimensional representations of these graphs, which are called network embeddings. These embeddings are then applied to solve a variety of biomedical challenges, including drug repurposing, predicting drug-target interactions, and improving patient diagnoses based on electronic health records. Ultimately, the review highlights the potential of knowledge graphs to integrate vast amounts of biomedical data and accelerate scientific discovery."
